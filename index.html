</h2>

<p>This project was designed to consume a text file and produce a tweet in the voice of that text. To do this we created a markovian text generator, which picks the next word based on what commonly followed that word in the inputted body of text. Below is an example of a tweet generated from the US Constitution:</p>

<p>"Compensation, which shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."</p>

</h2>

<p>In this project we created command-line minesweeper. It takes in a width, height, and a number of bombs and then creates the board. You can then enter [x, y] coordinates to pick a square and it will show you the number of bombs it is touching. If your not careful, you could step right on a bomb and lose the game!</p>

</h2>

<p>This project is a one machine private e-mail server. First the user is prompted to sign-in or register. It then shows them how many emails they have and who it is from. They are then prompted to write an e-mail or read an email from a specific user. The information is saved in a SQLite3 database, where the password is hashed and the message is encrypted with a passphrase selected by the user. This passphrase must be entered by the recipient in order to decrypt the message into plain text. </p>
